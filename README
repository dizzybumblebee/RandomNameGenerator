Simple java-based name generator

Planned:
- Generates (first) names based on given language's letter set
- Customizable: Accept pre-set letter picking patterns ("consonant-vowel", "consonant-vowel-vowel" etc)
- Extensible: Can easily be expanded with additional languages and letter sets
- Various outputs: GUI as well as export to .txt, .csv and more
